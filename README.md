# kraz

### What is this?

This is just a dumb IRC bot I wrote for some friends, the code is public in
case others might find bits and pieces of it useful. If so, feel free!

### Why is it called kraz?

[kraz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Corvi) also known as Beta Corvi
is a star in the constellation Corvus and nobody knows why it was called
kraz. Since naming things is hard it seemed appropriate.
